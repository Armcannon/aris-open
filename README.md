Hi there. Now we're here. 
So let me just walk you through the Aris oepn project. 

The core module is "open", simple and straightforward. 

Based on "open" module, we have module "sample" which applies "android" scale. The code in this module is really simple and all you need to concern about is the class "YourPipe".

After you've ran the "sample" module, made some changes, let's move to module "pipes" where you can check the source code of nearly every pipe available on Pipe Store. 

To be continued...
